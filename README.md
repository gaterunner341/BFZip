# BFZip
A brute force tool for password protected zip files using a dictionary file

BFZip is compatable with Python 2.7, and currently does not fully work in Python 3.x.

This script uses argeparse for a user to supply a dictionary file and to designte the
password protected zip file.  Verbose, with a -v, is also optional argument.
